When notes and analyses present different perspectives, prioritize the notes. The notes represent direct human judgment and observations, while analyses are automated summaries.

{context}

## Your Task

Write a comprehensive, objective performance review suitable for multiple audiences, with the individual as the primary consumer. This should sound professional, fair, empathetic, and honest - not like it came from an automated system.

**Critical Guidelines:**
- **NEVER use second person** ("you", "your", "you've") or first person ("I", "we", "our team", "I've seen", "I noticed")
- **ALWAYS use third person** throughout (e.g., "{user_data["user"]} demonstrated", "{user_data["user"]} has shown", "{user_data["user"]} would benefit from")
- **NEVER mention levels, level numbers, or level-related language** - Avoid phrases like "current level", "next level", "L4", "L5", "L6", "beyond the expectations for the current level", "toward the next level", "exceeds expectations for this level", or any similar level-based comparisons
- **Never mention** "analysis", "metrics", "data", "reports", "automated", "scripts", or any technical terms that would reveal this is AI-generated
- **Avoid sourcing phrases** - Don't use phrases like "Peer feedback indicates", "Observations show", "It has been noted that", "Feedback suggests", "Reports indicate". Instead, state observations directly (e.g., "Ariel sometimes hesitates" not "Peer feedback indicates that Ariel sometimes hesitates")
- Use objective, professional language appropriate for multiple audiences
- **Balance empathy with honesty**: Write with understanding and compassion while being direct and truthful about performance
- **Be realistic and honest**: The individual needs constructive feedback to grow - don't shy away from difficult feedback, but deliver it with empathy
- Show empathy when discussing challenges or development areas - frame feedback constructively and acknowledge the human side of growth
- Be honest about both strengths and areas for improvement - provide realistic assessments
- **Reference specific projects, initiatives, and technical designs** - Always name concrete examples from the analysis reports (e.g., "SDDM V1 project", "Discriminator refactor", "Gemini migration design document"). Avoid abstract descriptions like "various projects" or "multiple initiatives". Be specific about what was accomplished. **Do NOT bold project names** - write them naturally without markdown formatting (e.g., "the SDDM V1 project" not "**SDDM V1 project**").
- Reference specific examples and contributions naturally, based on the provided information
- Maintain a balanced, fair tone that recognizes achievements while providing constructive feedback
- Focus on observable behaviors, outcomes, and impact rather than personal opinions
- Write as if documenting performance based on evidence and observations, but with genuine care for the individual's growth
- **Do NOT include a personal greeting or introduction** - start directly with the content sections

Base your review on (in order of priority):
1. **Self-reflections and feedback (from notes)** - This is the HIGHEST PRIORITY source. The notes contain human-written feedback, self-reviews, and direct observations. Weight this information most heavily when writing the review.
2. **1:1 conversations and discussions (from meeting notes)** - These represent direct, personal interactions and should be weighted heavily.
3. **Work contributions and impact (from the analysis reports)** - Use these as supporting context, but notes take precedence when there are differences in emphasis or perspective.
4. **Expectations from the organizational framework** - Use for context on what good performance looks like.
5. **Fair comparison with peers** - Use for calibration context.

**CRITICAL**: When notes and analyses present different perspectives or emphasis, prioritize the notes. The notes represent human judgment and direct feedback, while analyses are automated summaries. The review should reflect the human perspective from notes more than the automated analysis perspective.

**CRITICAL**: Write EXCLUSIVELY in third person. NEVER use "you", "your", "I", "we", or "our team". NEVER mention levels, level numbers, or level-related language (e.g., "current level", "next level", "L4/L5/L6", "beyond expectations for this level"). The individual is the primary consumer and needs honest, constructive feedback. Be realistic and direct while maintaining empathy.

Format your response as a well-structured markdown document with proper headings and formatting. Write in an objective, professional tone throughout. Do NOT include any personal greeting, salutation, or introduction - start directly with the content sections.

The review should follow this structure:

## Key Achievements

What are 1-2 key achievements of this individual during the review period, and how have these contributions positively impacted the business, team, or their professional development?

Write this section EXCLUSIVELY in third person. **Start with a summary paragraph** describing the overall achievements and their impact. Then provide **2-3 bullet points** in the format: `* **Concept Title**: Action/description`. Each bullet should highlight a concrete accomplishment with a bolded concept title followed by a colon and the specific action or impact. Use phrases like "{user_data["user"]} demonstrated", "{user_data["user"]} successfully", "{user_data["user"]} showed", "{user_data["user"]} has made significant contributions". **CRITICAL: Reference specific projects, initiatives, and technical designs by name** (e.g., "the SDDM V1 project", "the Discriminator refactor", "the Gemini migration design document"). Avoid abstract descriptions - be concrete and specific about what was accomplished. **Do NOT bold project names in the paragraph** - write them naturally without markdown formatting. Be specific about the impact and outcomes. NEVER use "you" or "your".

Example format:
[Summary paragraph describing overall achievements]

* **Project Leadership**: [Specific action and impact with project name]
* **Technical Architecture**: [Specific action and impact with project name]
* **Team Enablement**: [Specific action and impact]

## Challenges and Development Areas

What are 1-2 specific challenges or blockers this person faced over the previous period? What improvements or suggestions would enhance their continued development and effectiveness?

Write this EXCLUSIVELY in third person with a constructive, empathetic, and honest tone. **Start with a summary paragraph** framing the overall challenges and development areas. Then provide **2-3 bullet points** in the format: `* **Concept Title**: Action/description`. Each bullet should be a specific, addressable observation with a bolded concept title followed by a colon and the specific challenge or development area. Frame challenges as growth opportunities with understanding. Use phrases like "{user_data["user"]} encountered", "{user_data["user"]} would benefit from", "{user_data["user"]} has room to grow in". State observations directly - avoid sourcing phrases like "Peer feedback indicates", "Observations show", or "It has been noted that". Just state things directly (e.g., "{user_data["user"]} sometimes hesitates" not "Peer feedback indicates that {user_data["user"]} sometimes hesitates"). Be honest and realistic about areas needing improvement while showing empathy and framing feedback constructively. Acknowledge that growth is a journey and challenges are normal. NEVER use "you" or "your".

Example format:
[Summary paragraph framing overall challenges and development areas]

* **Vocal Leadership**: [Specific challenge or development area]
* **Strategic Influence**: [Specific challenge or development area]

## Development Focus

What key skills should this individual focus on developing in the coming period to enhance their performance and career growth? How will these skills benefit their role, team, and organization?

Write this EXCLUSIVELY in third person, framing development areas objectively. **Start with a summary paragraph** describing the overall development focus and its benefits. Then provide **2-3 bullet points** in the format: `* **Concept Title**: Action/description`. Each bullet should be a specific, actionable development area with a bolded concept title followed by a colon and the specific action or skill to develop. Use phrases like "{user_data["user"]} should focus on", "{user_data["user"]} would benefit from developing", "{user_data["user"]} needs to strengthen", "Key areas for growth include". Connect skills to their growth trajectory and expectations. Be realistic and specific. NEVER use "you" or "your". NEVER mention levels, level numbers, or phrases like "next level", "current level", or similar level-based language.

Example format:
[Summary paragraph describing overall development focus]

* **Technical Leadership**: [Specific action or skill to develop]
* **Cross-functional Influence**: [Specific action or skill to develop]
